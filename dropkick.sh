# DROPKICK.SH 
#
# Detect and Disconnect the DropCam and Withings devices some people are using to
# spy on guests in their home, especially in AirBnB rentals. Based on Glasshole.sh:

#
# This script was named by Adam Harvey (http://ahprojects.com), who also
# encouraged me to write it. It requires a GNU/Linux host (laptop, Raspberry Pi,
# etc) and the aircrack-ng suite. I put 'beep' in there for a little audio
# notification. Comment it out if you don't need it.
#
# See also http://plugunplug.net, for a plug-and-play device that does this
# based on OpenWrt. Code here:
